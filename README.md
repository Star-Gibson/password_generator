## Description
The goal of the Password Generator project was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
